# Fix for Cab Bookings Issue

## Issues Found
1. **Bookings Not Displaying**: Cab bookings are not being displayed on the transport service provider dashboard because they are not linked to any service provider. All bookings have `provider_id = 0`, which means they don't appear when the transport service provider logs in.

2. **Booking Actions Not Working**: The booking actions (confirm, complete, cancel) are not working because the `cab_bookings` table is missing required timestamp columns: `confirmed_at`, `completed_at`, and `cancelled_at`.

## Solutions
We've created several scripts to fix these issues:

1. **Link Bookings to Provider**:
   - `fix_cab_bookings.sql` or `update_provider_id.php` - Update all cab bookings to link them to the transport service provider (ID 1).

2. **Fix Missing Table Columns**:
   - `fix_booking_columns.php` - Add the missing timestamp columns to the cab_bookings table to enable booking actions.

## How to Run the Fixes

### Step 1: Link Cab Bookings to Provider
#### Option 1: Using the Web Browser (Easiest)
1. Make sure your WAMP server is running
2. Open your web browser and go to:
   - `http://localhost/palliative/update_provider_id.php`
   - If you're using a different port, use: `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/palliative/update_provider_id.php`
3. You should see a success message showing how many bookings were updated

#### Option 2: Using a Database Management Tool
1. Open phpMyAdmin (typically at http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Log in and select the `palliative` database
3. Click on the SQL tab
4. Paste the following SQL query:
   ```sql
   UPDATE cab_bookings 
   SET provider_id = 1 
   WHERE provider_id = 0 OR provider_id IS NULL;
   ```
5. Click "Go" to execute the query

### Step 2: Fix Booking Table Structure
1. After running the first fix, navigate to:
   - `http://localhost/palliative/fix_booking_columns.php`
   - If you're using a different port, use: `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/palliative/fix_booking_columns.php`
2. The script will add the missing columns to the `cab_bookings` table:
   - `confirmed_at` - Timestamp when a booking is confirmed
   - `completed_at` - Timestamp when a booking is completed
   - `cancelled_at` - Timestamp when a booking is cancelled
3. You should see a success message confirming the columns were added

## Verification
After running both fixes:
1. Log in as the transport service provider
2. Go to the transport dashboard (`index.php?module=service&action=transport_dashboard`)
3. The dashboard should now show the correct number of bookings
4. Try confirming, completing, or cancelling a booking - these actions should now work correctly

## Additional Fixes Applied
We've also updated the following:
1. Fixed the redirect targets for booking actions (confirm, complete, cancel) to return to the transport dashboard
2. Updated the booking notes functionality to keep you on the same page after saving notes
3. Fixed an issue with undefined array key "destination_address" in the dashboard view
4. Added error detail display in the booking action error messages to provide more helpful feedback
